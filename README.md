Steps to contribute to a project in your organization 

I will contribute to a project as follows:
- git clone (repo Url)  To clone remote project repository into my local machine using.
- git checkout -b feature  To create a new feature branch and switch into it using.
- Then, I will add the modification e.g. “vi contact.txt”, add a new contact number and address.
- git add .  to move files from working area to staging area
- git commit -m ‘contact info added’  to commit files into local repo 
- git checkout main  to switch into the main branch
- git push origin dev  to push the feature branch to the remote repo
- Then I will go to the UI of the remote repo and create a pull request to compare main branch (base) with the dev and assign it to a senior engineer to review the PR before merging to the main branch.
